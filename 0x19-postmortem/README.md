Issue Summary:
Duration: May 15, 2023, 10:00 AM (GMT) to May 15, 2023, 2:00 PM (GMT)
Impact: The service "XYZ Web Application" experienced a complete outage during the specified duration. Users were unable to access the application, resulting in a 100% service disruption.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in one of the core database servers supporting the XYZ Web Application. The failure occurred due to a power supply unit (PSU) malfunction, which caused the server to shut down abruptly.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring systems reported a sudden drop in server response times.
10:10 AM: Engineers investigating the issue noticed multiple database connection errors in the logs and suspected a potential database failure.
10:30 AM: The database team initiated investigations into the database servers to determine the root cause of the issue.
11:00 AM: As initial investigations did not reveal any obvious issues, the network team was also involved to rule out any network-related problems.
12:00 PM: After exhausting multiple investigation paths, it was discovered that the PSU of one of the core database servers had failed, causing the server to shut down.
12:30 PM: The incident was escalated to the senior management and relevant stakeholders to keep them informed about the situation.
1:00 PM: The hardware team replaced the faulty PSU, and the affected server was brought back online.
2:00 PM: The XYZ Web Application was fully restored, and users regained access to the service.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a power supply unit (PSU) malfunction in one of the core database servers. The failed PSU caused the server to shut down, leading to a complete disruption of the XYZ Web Application. To resolve the issue, the faulty PSU was replaced with a new one, and the affected server was brought back online. With the restoration of the server, the application's functionality was fully recovered.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents and improve the overall system resilience, the following measures are recommended:

Improve Monitoring: Enhance monitoring systems to provide more granular visibility into hardware components, such as power supplies, to detect failures promptly.

Redundancy and Failover: Implement redundant power supply units and redundant servers to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of hardware failures.

Regular Maintenance: Establish a schedule for routine maintenance and inspections of critical hardware components to identify potential issues proactively and prevent unexpected failures.

Incident Response Training: Conduct regular incident response drills to ensure a swift and efficient response during critical situations. This will help improve coordination among teams and minimize downtime.

Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Document the incident, including root cause analysis and resolution steps, and share it with the relevant teams. This will enhance the collective knowledge and enable quicker troubleshooting in the future.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Conduct an inventory of critical hardware components and assess their health status.
Implement redundant power supply units for all core database servers.
Establish a routine maintenance schedule for inspecting and replacing aging hardware components.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts for hardware failures.
Conduct incident response training sessions to improve coordination and response time.
In conclusion, the XYZ Web Application experienced a complete outage due to a power supply unit (PSU) failure in one of the core database servers. The issue was promptly detected and resolved, with the faulty PSU being replaced. To prevent future incidents, measures such as improved monitoring, redundancy, and regular maintenance are recommended. By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, the system's reliability and availability will be significantly enhanced.
